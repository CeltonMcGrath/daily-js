**A note on the default branch name**

For anyone currently depending on bleeding-edge, not-yet-published changes in `daily-js`: the name of the default branch where these changes land is **`main`**. Please make sure your `package.json` reflects this.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@daily-co/daily-js": "daily-co/daily-js#main"
  }
}
